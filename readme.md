# ReadMe.md

This is the code for my personal website, [TimTr.com](https://timtr.com) and TimTriemstra.com.


## Overview

So far this code is pretty basic, with a single page of HTML, and one of CSS (located in the `assets` folder). 


## TODO

- Make the maximum width more constrained. Can get too wide to read. Notably the dark area up has have a different apparent width than the rest of the page. Should get those in alignment as well.

- Add a sidebar for navigation, just simple aligned text. Do this in a separate branch.



## Acknowledgements

The CSS used on this site was originally modified from a project by [Jenil Gogari on GitHub](https://github.com/jenil/chota) that gave this site a jump-start in looking presentable. Thanks for making your work public so others can learn and benefit.
